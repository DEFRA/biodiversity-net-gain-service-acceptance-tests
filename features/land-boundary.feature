Feature: land-boundary

    As a BNG User
    I need to provide the location and boundary of the land I am registering
    So that I can provide the Register Operator with the data in a file type consistent with technology I already use


    Background:
        Given I am on the "land-boundary-options" page

    Scenario: There is an option to upload geospatial and non geospatial data

    Scenario: I can visually confirm my uploaded land boundary file is correct (before continuing)

    Scenario: The address, grid reference, and latitude and longitude are accurate

    Scenario: There is an option for me to choose a different way to provide the land boundary after upload.

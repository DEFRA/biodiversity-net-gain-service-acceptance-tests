Feature: Developer Journey Tests

    As a developer
    I need to see the status of the sections I need to complete
    So that I can track the progress of my allocation of off-site biodiversity gains to a development.

    Background: Choose to record off-site gains for a new development
        Given I choose to manage biodiversity gains
        # // nav bar manage link should really be baseurl
        And I choose to manage my off-site gains for my development projects
        And I choose to record off-site gains for a new development
        And I am on the "developer/tasklist" page

    Scenario: BNGP-2194 2, 5 - The sections on the task list page should show the status of progress.
        # Applicant Info
        # Add details about the applicant
        And I choose to add "developer-applicant-info" details
        When I have completed the "developer" applicant information section
        Then I should see my progress as "You have completed 1 of 5 sections."
        And I should see the "developer-applicant-info" section status as "Completed"
        And I should see the "biodiversity gain site information" section status as "Not started"
        And I should see the "Development Project" section status as "Not started"
        And I should see the "planning decision notice" section status as "Not started"
        And I should see the "check-and-submit" section status as "Cannot start yet"
